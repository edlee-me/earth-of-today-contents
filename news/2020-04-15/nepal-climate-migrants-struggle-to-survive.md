Dhye 是尼泊爾北部 Mustang 區域的一個村落，那裡作物矮突、一片枯寂，水是稀有之物。唯一的學校在幾年前已經關閉，糧食越來越稀缺。大多數家庭已經遷走，他們在人禍面前無能為力。

他們只是**尼泊爾的氣候難民**的一個縮影。

整個喜馬拉雅區域的南亞人的生計，都經受著氣候變遷的威脅。重度依靠水資源的尼泊爾北部山民，只能遷徙到海拔較低的地方繼續生存。

其中，南亞居民首當其衝。去年，印度最大的城市之一的欽奈，因為雨季降水量出奇地少，[該地水資源幾乎斷絕](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/21/climate/chennai-india-water-shortage-images.html)；根據環境公正基金會的估算，到 2050 年，[孟加拉將會有一千八百萬人](https://ejfoundation.org/reports/climate-displacement-in-bangladesh)會因為海平面升高而需要搬遷；極端高溫氣候令南亞居民身體虛弱、更加貧窮。如果控制氣候變化的措施未能成功，南亞將會有**八千萬人**的[生活水平會因此大幅下降](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/28/climate/india-pakistan-warming-hotspots.html?module=inline)。

2016 年，為了預防山洪災難，尼泊爾軍隊將珠穆朗瑪峰附近的一個湖泊的水抽乾了。[去年另一份報告](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331662558_Supraglacial_pond_evolution_in_the_Everest_region_central_Himalaya_2015-2018)發現，冰川頂上融冰聚成的湖泊，其擴張速度在過去三年，比本世紀初的頭 15 年都要快很多。這些湖泊一方面證明了冰川正在急遽融化，另一方面也會加速冰川的融化。

Dhye，這個海拔三千六百多米的尼泊爾村落就是一個典型例子。十幾年前，這條村的所有家庭聚在一起討論一個沈重的議題：還要不要繼續留在這裡。

目之所及的，是一片棕黃乾癟的土地，連大麥都難以種活。土壤沒有養分、降雨難以預測，以及對飢荒的恐懼都是他們考量的因素。數百年來，他們以雙手，搭起土房子，每一塊泥坯，都來自這片父母掩埋新生兒臍帶的土地。

會議結束後，26 個家庭中的 17 個，合計約 90 人，決定離開。

過去的數年來，離開的人分批出發，背起食物和衣服，徒步約 1.6 公里，到一條尚有流水的河邊駐紮。他們將新村落取名為 Dhye Khola，意為「水體」。

但生活依然艱難。Gurung 先生是新村落的領導者，他說政府的不支持他們搬遷，保守派出爾反爾拒絕提供蘋果幼苗，Gurung 先生為此衝進他們的辦公室，威脅要放火，這些人才最後提供了 275 株幼苗。

為了預防夏天雨季的洪水氾濫，Dhye Khola 的村民開始築起堤壩；他們還需要想辦法防範附近生存困難的村民變作匪徒，來掠奪他們的蘋果園。

另一位也姓 Gurung 的婦人，最近丈夫患癌離世，剩下的錢日漸綿薄，她為此惆悵萬分。家附近的井也已經枯竭。她詛咒那些阻撓她在大城市銷售野生草藥的當地警察，她認為，他們這是在對 Dhye Khola 的新居民爭取權益所做的各種行動進行報復。

她說：「我們經歷了各種苦難，不是為了享樂。我祈求神會拯救我們。」

# As Himalayas Warm, Nepal’s Climate Migrants Struggle to Survive

Pushed out of their village by a drought and lack of food, a group of Nepalis are fighting to amplify the voices of those forced to relocate by the planet’s warming.

DHYE, Nepal — High in the Himalayas, on a rugged plateau dotted with empty mud huts, an exodus has begun.

**In the village of Dhye, crops are stubby, dead stalks. Water is scarce**. The only school closed a few years ago. With dwindling food, most families have packed their belongings and left, driven out by a faceless, man-made enemy.

> Dhye 是尼泊爾北部 Mustang 區域的一個村落，那裡作物矮突、一片枯寂，水是稀有之物。唯一的學校在幾年前已經關閉，糧食越來越稀缺。大多數家庭已經遷走，他們在人禍面前無能為力。

They are **Nepal’s climate-change migrants**, and there will be more.

> 他們只是**尼泊爾的氣候難民**的一個縮影。

“I love this village,” said Sonam Chhiring Gurung, 76, one of the final holdouts, “but I can’t survive here much longer.”

Climate change is remaking the Himalayan region, putting at risk millions of South Asians who depend on its water resources and pushing mountain dwellers in northern Nepal, home to the world’s highest peaks, to build new settlements at lower altitudes.

Yak herders say they are struggling to find grazing patches for their animals. Scientists have found that rising temperatures could spread malaria and dengue to new areas of the Himalayas, where mosquitoes [have started to appear in the highlands.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/09/140925082235.htm)

Around the world, tens of millions of people have already been displaced as a result of a warming planet. Researchers estimate that the number of climate-change migrants — those fleeing natural disasters, droughts or other calamities — [could reach a billion by the end of the century.](https://www.eco-business.com/news/climate-change-will-force-mass-migration-of-1-billion-by-2100/)

South Asians are among the most vulnerable. Last year, after an unusually weak monsoon, [water nearly ran out in Chennai](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/06/21/climate/chennai-india-water-shortage-images.html), one of India’s biggest cities. In Bangladesh, [up to 18 million people face displacement by 2050 from sea rise alone](https://ejfoundation.org/reports/climate-displacement-in-bangladesh), according to the Environmental Justice Foundation. Extreme heat is making people [sicker and poorer](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/climate/india-heat-wave-summer.html), and [could sharply diminish the living standards](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/06/28/climate/india-pakistan-warming-hotspots.html?module=inline) of 800 million people in the region if goals for mitigating climate change are not met.

Warmer Himalayas could have disastrous consequences for the subcontinent.

Last year, in one of the most complete studies on mountain warming, scientists warned that even if the world’s most ambitious climate change targets were met, [at least one-third of Himalayan glaciers would melt by the end of the century](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/04/world/asia/himalayas-glaciers-warming.html).

<strong>If global warming and greenhouse gas emissions continue at their current rates, the region could lose two-thirds of its glaciers by 2100, according to the report, [the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-92288-1).</strong>

“In the long term, the impacts will be profound for hundreds of millions of people in the plains,” said David Molden, the director general of the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development in Kathmandu. “If we overlay significantly changed rain and river flow patterns, it will be a mess for people depending on Asia’s big rivers for irrigation and drinking water.”

In a country where nearly 70 percent of people work in agriculture, an acceleration in extreme weather may “reverse and undermine decades of development gains and potentially undermine all our efforts to eradicate poverty,” said Ayshanie Medagangoda-Labé, the United Nations Development Program’s representative for Nepal.

“Nepal is ground zero for the impacts of climate change,” she said. “As a country with one of the most fragile ecosystems — the Himalayas — and an economy that is heavily reliant on favorable climate conditions, Nepal is probably one of the most exposed.”

Glimpses of a warmer future are everywhere.

In 2016, Nepal’s army drained a lake near Mount Everest after rapid glacial melting threatened to cause a catastrophic flood downstream. [A study released last year](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331662558_Supraglacial_pond_evolution_in_the_Everest_region_central_Himalaya_2015-2018) found that the size of ponds on top of glaciers in the region — which can both signal melting and accelerate it — had rapidly increased over the past three years, far outpacing the rate of change from the first decade and a half of the 2000s.

The number of climate change migrants in Nepal’s Himalayas is unknown, though local officials in mountain towns estimate it to be in the thousands. Min Bahadur Shahi, a member of the government’s commission for development work, said officials planned to track the impact of warming temperatures for the first time through coming census questions.

“Our first priority should be helping those displaced from the climate crisis,” he said.

Take the case of Dhye, in the remote Mustang region of Nepal, about 12,000 feet above sea level.

More than a decade ago, the village’s families gathered for a meeting to ponder a heavy question: Should they stay?

They looked around their landscape, a brown, dehydrated expanse that could barely sustain barley anymore. They weighed soil degradation, newly erratic rainfall and fears of starvation against centuries of lived history — the huts they had built with their hands, the pockets of earth where parents had buried each newborn’s umbilical cord.

> 會議結束後，26 個家庭中的 17 個，合計約 90 人，決定離開。

-By the end of the meeting, 17 of 26 families, about 90 people, vowed to leave.

“I couldn’t stay,” said Tsering Lamke Gurung, 54, a village leader and father of eight, four of whom have died. “My children and I were not able to survive from crop failure.”

-The leavers have trickled out of Dhye in groups over the past few years. They strapped bundles of food and clothing to their backs and hiked nearly a mile down to the banks of a still-flowing stream. They called their new community Dhye Khola, a local name for the water body.

> 過去的數年來，離開的人分批出發，背起食物和衣服，徒步約 1.6 公里，到一條尚有流水的河邊駐紮。他們將新村落取名為 Dhye Khola，意為「水體」。

There were some moments of triumph. One resident sent pictures of the uncultivated land to a French aid agency, which agreed to plant fruit trees in the village and help build sturdier concrete homes for families.

But the longer-term settlement process was fraught, illustrating the challenges migrants face in procuring resources for unrecognized villages where residents have no legal right to the land.

-Mr. Gurung, who took the lead in building Dhye Khola, said he approached a former prime minister of Nepal for guidance and aid. He met prominent lawmakers, a Nepal-based leader of the World Wildlife Fund and representatives from foreign embassies.

“They didn’t support us,” Mr. Gurung said. “They wouldn’t help us get a land ownership certificate.”

-When a government conservation group backed away from its promise of providing apple seedlings for Dhye Khola, Mr. Gurung said he marched into its office and threatened to burn it down. He said the group eventually relented and sent about 275 seedlings.

“To those who say climate change is fake and criticize us for occupying public land, I ask them to come visit our village,” Mr. Gurung said. “I am a victim of climate change.”

Some wondered how long it would take before their next move, pointing out that broader warming trends were impossible to escape.

-To protect against flooding during the summer monsoon, residents of Dhye Khola have started building embankments near the stream. They strategized about what to do if their apple orchards were marauded by locals from other struggling villages.

> 為了預防夏天雨季的洪水氾濫，Dhye Khola 的村民開始築起堤壩；他們還需要想辦法防範附近生存困難的村民變作匪徒，來掠奪他們的蘋果園。

-Tsering Bitik Gurung, 52, a farm laborer with a sun-creased face, said the stress was getting to her.

-Ms. Gurung, who is not related to Tsering Lamke Gurung, agonized over the recent death of her husband from cancer and her diminishing money. The well near her home has gone dry. She cursed local police officers who prevented her from selling wild herbs in one of the bigger cities — retribution, she said, for villagers’ persistent efforts to get Dhye Khola recognized.

> 另一位也姓 Gurung 的婦人，最近丈夫患癌離世，剩下的錢日漸綿薄，她為此惆悵萬分。家附近的井也已經枯竭。她詛咒那些阻撓她在大城市銷售野生草藥的當地警察，她認為，他們這是在對 Dhye Khola 的新居民爭取權益所做的各種行動進行報復。

Sitting next to her stove, Ms. Gurung sighed. The apple orchards are bountiful for now, she said, but “our future is dark.”

-“We came here after hardship, not for fun,” she said. “I pray that God will save us.”

> 她說：「我們經歷了各種苦難，不是為了享樂。我祈求神會拯救我們。」
