來自CREA（能源及潔淨空氣研究中心）的衛星圖片顯示，由於新冠疫情導致的工業生產停滯，空氣污染的主要來源——二氧化氮——的排放銳減，尤其是義大利以及中國這兩個重災區。

義大利是歐洲工業重地，工業生產占其 GDP 的 24%。疫情爆發後工商業叫停，學校、商店甚至一些教堂都關閉了。從 ESA（歐洲太空局）的視頻可以清晰地看到，1月1日至3月11日期間，義大利經濟減緩導致的氮氧化物排放的減少令整個歐洲的空氣質素上升。

除此以外，水路航運的減少，令威尼斯運河變得清澈，甚至開始出現幼魚。但是專家警惕說，這未必證明水質變好。

中國方面，作為工業廢氣及溫室氣體排放大國，今年春節的空氣質量也與往年迥異。

湖北省附近的二氧化氮排放量銳減（40%），而且，由於人們減少出行，其他污染物像 PM2.5 等，也因為煤電消耗減少而減少（約25%）。

如今中國疫情緩解，各地開始復工，二氧化氮排放是否會回歸到疫前水平還是未知之數。東亞綠色和平組織高級氣候政策顧問李碩（音譯）稱：「回彈效應，也被稱為『報復性污染』有時會令污染比以往更深，此種情況在中國也曾發生過。」

There’s a high chance you’re reading this while practicing social distancing, or while your corner of the world is under some type of advised or enforced lockdown.

While these are necessary measures to contain the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, such economic interruption is unprecedented in many ways—resulting in some surprising side effects.

### The Evidence is in NO₂ Emissions

Nitrogen dioxide (NO₂) emissions, a major air pollutant, are closely linked to factory output and vehicles operating on the road.

<strong>As both industry and transport come to a halt during this pandemic, NO₂ emissions can be a good indicator of global economic activity—and the changes are visible from space.</strong>

These images from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air ( [CREA](https://twitter.com/CREACleanAir/status/1238370147611656192) ), as well as satellite footage from NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA), show a drastic decline in NO₂ emissions over recent months, particularly across Italy and China.

### NO₂ Emissions Across Italy

In Italy, the number of active COVID-19 cases has surpassed China (including the [death toll](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/uk-schools-close-italy-covid-19-deaths-jump-live-updates-200318235116951.html) ). <strong>Amid emergency actions to lock down the entire nation, everything from schools and shops, to restaurants and even some churches, are closed.</strong>

<strong>Italy is also an industrial hub, with the sector accounting for nearly [24% of GDP](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/resources/the-world-factbook/geos/it.html).</strong> With many Italians urged to work from home if possible, visible economic activity has dropped considerably. 

This 10-day moving average animation (from January 1st—March 11th, 2020) of nitrogen dioxide emissions across Europe clearly demonstrates how the drop in Italy’s economic activity has impacted the environment.

<strong>That’s not all: a drop in boat traffic also means that [Venice’s canals](https://globalnews.ca/news/6683226/climate-change-coronavirus/) are clear for the time being, as small fish have begun inhabiting the waterways again. Experts are cautious to note that this does not necessarily mean the water quality is better.</strong>

### NO₂ Emissions Across China

The emissions changes above China are possibly even more obvious to the eye. <strong>China is the world’s most important manufacturing hub and a significant [contributor](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/all-the-worlds-carbon-emissions-in-one-chart/) to greenhouse gases globally.</strong> But in the month following Lunar New Year (a week-long festival in early February), satellite imagery painted a different picture.

<strong>NO₂ emissions around the Hubei province, the original epicenter of the virus, steeply dropped as factories were forced to shutter their doors for the time being.</strong>

<strong>What’s more, there were measurable effects in the decline of other [emission types](https://twitter.com/CREACleanAir/status/1238370150941933569?s=20) from the drop in coal use during the same time, compared to years prior.</strong>

## Back to the Status Quo?

In recent weeks, China has been able to [flatten the curve](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/infection-trajectory-flattening-the-covid19-curve/) of its total COVID-19 cases. As a result, the government is beginning to ease its restrictions—and it’s clear that social and economic activities are starting to pick back up in March.

<strong>With the regular chain of events beginning to resume, it remains to be seen whether NO₂ emissions will rebound right back to their pre-pandemic levels.</strong>

> <strong>This bounce-back effect—which can sometimes reverse any overall drop in emissions—is [called] “revenge pollution”. And in China, it has precedent.</strong>
