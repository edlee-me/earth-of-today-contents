一份澳大利亞與美國科學家的研究報告說：狩獵、農業以及全球城市化進程導致生化多樣化的嚴重破壞，會增加人類遭受類似新冠疫情危機的風險。

該報告指出人類與野生動物的高頻接觸，讓很多本來不應該存在於人類周圍的病毒，有機會讓人類成為病原體。

已被人類馴化的牲畜如牛、羊、狗等的動物身上帶有的病毒種類與人類相仿，其重合度是其他野生哺乳類動物的八倍。

一些已經適應人類環境的野生動物，如嚙齒動物、蝙蝠和靈長類動物這些經常出沒於城市與農場的動物，其攜帶的病毒種類與人類的重合度也比自然生態中的野生動物要高。這些動物所帶病毒的總和占已知病毒總數的 75%。單就蝙蝠而言，就與 Sars、尼巴病毒、馬爾堡病毒和伊波拉病毒相關。

人類對自然生態的干擾，讓新型病毒有機會通過與野生動物的接觸而引進，進而通過人類感染其他動物、導致物種滅絕。現在我們面臨的困境，就很可能是這種擴張行為引發的連串後果。

為了避免這種局面的再度發生，我們必須審慎地處理人類與野生動物的關係，做到安全地共存。

另一方面，超過200個來自全世界的野生動物保護組織致信世界衛生組織（WHO），呼籲重視當今深宵塵土的野生動植物交易活動，希望永久禁止野生動植物交易市場以及野生動植物入藥等行為。他們說，在全球範圍內禁止野生動植物交易可以防止疾病蔓延，強調此種交易是物種滅絕的重要原因。

這些組織稱，寄生傳染病，包括伊波拉、MERS、HIV、瘋牛症、狂犬病、鉤體病等，每年導致超過二十億人患病，超過二百萬人死亡。

# Human impact on wildlife to blame for spread of viruses, says study

<strong>Hunting, farming and the global move of people to cities has led to massive declines in biodiversity and increased the risk of dangerous viruses like Covid-19 spilling over from animals to humans, a major study has concluded.</strong>

<strong>In a paper that suggests the underlying cause of the present pandemic is likely to be increased human contact with wildlife, scientists from Australia and the US traced which animals were most likely to share pathogens with humans.</strong>

Taking 142 viruses known to have been transmitted from animals to humans over many years, they matched them to the [IUCN’s red list of threatened species](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/iucn-red-list).

<strong>Domesticated animals like cattle, sheep, dogs and goats shared the highest number of viruses with humans, with eight times more animal-borne viruses than wild mammal species.</strong>

<strong>Wild animals that have adapted well to human-dominated environments also share more viruses with people. Rodents, bats and primates – which often live among people, and close to houses and farms – together were implicated as hosts for nearly 75% of all viruses. Bats alone have been linked to diseases like Sars, Nipah, Marburg and Ebola.</strong>

The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that the spillover risk was highest from threatened and endangered wild animals whose populations had declined largely due to hunting, the wildlife trade and loss of habitat.

<strong>“Human encroachment into biodiverse areas increases the risk of spillover of novel infectious diseases by enabling new contacts between humans and wildlife</strong> … We found that species in the primate and bat orders were significantly more likely to harbour zoonotic viruses compared to all other orders,” it said.

<strong>“Spillover of viruses from animals are a direct result of our actions involving wildlife and their habitat,”</strong> said lead author Christine Kreuder Johnson, director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the One Health Institute, a programme of the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine.

<strong>“The consequence is they’re sharing their viruses with us. These actions simultaneously threaten species survival and increase the risk of spillover. In an unfortunate convergence of many factors, this brings about the kind of mess we’re in now,”</strong> she said.

“We need to be really attentive to how we interact with wildlife and the activities that bring humans and wildlife together. We obviously don’t want pandemics of this scale. We need to find ways to co-exist safely with wildlife, as they have no shortages of viruses to give us,” said Johnson.

<strong>Separately, [more than 200 of the world’s wildlife groups](https://lioncoalition.org/2020/04/04/open-letter-to-world-health-organisation/) have written to the World Health Organization (WHO) calling on it to recommend to countries a highly precautionary approach to the multi-billion dollar wildlife trade, and a permanent ban on all live wildlife markets and the use of wildlife in traditional medicine.</strong>

The Covid-19 pandemic, says the letter, is believed to have originated at wildlife markets in China, and to have been transmitted to humans as a result of the close proximity between wildlife and people.

The groups, which include the International Fund for Animal Welfare, the Zoological Society of London and Peta, say <strong>a ban on wildlife markets globally will help prevent the spread of disease, and address “one of the major drivers of species extinction”</strong>.

“This decisive action, well within the WHO’s mandate, would be an impactful first step in adopting a highly precautionary approach to wildlife trade that poses a risk to human health,” says the letter.

<strong>The organisations argue that zoonotic diseases are responsible for over 2 billion cases of human illness and over 2 million human deaths each year, including from Ebola, Mers, HIV, bovine tuberculosis, rabies, and leptospirosis.</strong>

The letter follows acting UN biodiversity chief [Elizabeth Maruma Mrema’s call](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/ban-live-animal-markets-pandemics-un-biodiversity-chief-age-of-extinction) in the Guardian this week for a global ban on wildlife markets.

Unlike the conservation groups, Mrema, the acting executive secretary of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, emphasised that millions of people, particularly in Africa, depend on wild animals for food and that alternatives to wet markets are needed.

In a growing sign that global organisations are embarrassed by the emergence of zoonotic diseases in traded animals, Cites, the body which regulates the international trade of animals, refused to be drawn into the growing debate about the origins of Covid-19.

In a terse statement it said: “Matters regarding zoonotic diseases are outside of Cites’s mandate and the Secretariat does not have the competence to make comments on the recent news on the possible links between human consumption of wild animals and Covid-19.”
