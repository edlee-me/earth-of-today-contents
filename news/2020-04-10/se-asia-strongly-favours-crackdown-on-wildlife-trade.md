世界野生動物基金（WWF）三月份在東南亞各國/地區，包括香港和日本，進行了5000份問卷調查，本週一發佈調查結果，其中93%的受訪者表示，應該禁止野生動物的非法交易，來防止瘟疫的再次爆發。

發佈會上，WWF亞太地區總監 Christy Williams 說：「這不單止是野生動物的存亡問題，這已經成為了**全球人類健康和經濟安全的問題**了。」

緬甸群眾對關停野生動物交易市場的慾望最強烈，多年以來，**緬甸在中國邊境附近的幾個自治區，野生動物交易一直堂而皇之地進行著**。在越南，有三分之一的受訪者表示這次的疫情讓他們決心不再消費野生動物產品。

中國在瘟疫的警示下，頒布了法令禁止一切野生動植物的人工繁殖及食用，但**沒有條款提及不得買賣野生動物作為寵物，也沒有說禁止野生動物入藥。**

聯合國東南亞及亞太地區負責毒品及罪案調查的代表 Jeremy Douglas 說，有些交易，一直是秘密的地下交易，尤其中緬邊境的自治區，有些民族武裝份子一直進行著野生動物走私活動，「我還是感到憂心忡忡。」

# After-coronavirus, SE Asia strongly favours crackdown on wildlife trade, says WWF

BANGKOK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has generated overwhelming support for the closure of markets selling illegal wildlife across Southeast Asia, an epicenter of the multi-billion-dollar trade, the World Wildlife Fund said in a public opinion poll on Monday.

<strong>About 93 per cent of about 5,000 people surveyed by WWF in March across three Southeast Asian nations as well as Hong Kong and Japan said unregulated markets selling wildlife should be shuttered to ward off future pandemics.</strong>

Scientists believe the virus that has upturned the lives of billions across the globe originated in a wildlife market, likely in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where bats, pangolins, and other animals known to transmit coronaviruses are crammed together in fetid conditions.

<strong>“This is no longer a wildlife problem. It is **a global security and human health and economic problem**,” Christy Williams, WWF’s Asia Pacific Director, said in a news conference, giving results of the survey.</strong>

<strong>Support for a crackdown on markets was strongest in **Myanmar, where wildlife has for years been traded openly in the autonomous regions bordering China**, while a third of respondents in Vietnam said the crisis had prompted them to stop consuming wildlife products.</strong>

“COVID is a wake-up call,” Grace Hwa, Illegal Wildlife Trade Programme Manager at WWF Myanmar, said in a statement. “The rampant unchecked trade in wildlife is a risk not only to health and the economy, but to the entire stability of the region.”

<strong>In the wake of the outbreak, which began in Wuhan and has since spanned the globe, China introduced a ban on all farming and consumption of live wildlife, but **it does not cover the trade in animals as pets, and for traditional medicine.**</strong>

> 中國在瘟疫的警示下，頒布了法令禁止一切野生動植物的人工繁殖及食用，但**沒有條款提及不得買賣野生動物作為寵物，也沒有說禁止野生動物入藥。**

Vietnam’s prime minister has ordered the agriculture ministry to draft a similar directive, banning wildlife trade and consumption.

Jeremy Douglas, Southeast Asia and Pacific representative for the U.N office on drugs and crime, said some of the trade had been driven underground.

<strong>“I’m really concerned about the special regions,” he told Reuters by phone, referring to autonomous zones on the Myanmar-China border controlled by ethnic armed groups which have long been a hub for wildlife trafficking.</strong>

Two residents of Mong La, a border town known as a hotbed of smuggling, told Reuters by phone the markets remained open but wildlife shops were shut.

“It is because the car routes are closed so the trade route cannot be done,” said Ye Min Tun, a 29-year-old construction worker.
