國際航運協會（Iata）近日與國際民航組織（ICAO）接觸，表示如果 Corsia（全稱 Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation 國際航空碳抵銷及減排計劃）的條款不根據疫情作出調整，將影響整個航空業的存亡，宣稱某些航空公司可能會退出此計劃。

在 Corsia 計劃的約束下，航空公司需要根據碳排放基準線，支付抵銷費用。受瘟疫影響，國際航線大面積停擺，意味著基準線會比預期低很多，航空公司的減排目標將更難實現。

Iata 向 ICAO 傳達的措辭是基準線「必須調整來保障整個行業的可持續發展」，並說道一些國家可能因為昂貴的費用而退出該協議。

3月13日，ICAO 簽訂協議，表示堅守 Corsia 計劃，不能因為瘟疫的影響而無視氣候危機。該舉動贏得環保運動人士的讚許。然而，航空公司對此卻表示出搖搖欲墜的信心。

[英國綠色聯盟](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Alliance)政策顧問 James Elliott 說：「減輕航空公司負擔的訴求可以理解，但氣候問題的緊迫性不容置疑。如果航空業現在不能找到疫情後恢復的方案（轉而尋求體恤政策），以後將會被更加嚴厲地規限。如果 Coria 計劃需要調整，也必定會以更強烈的決心，更嚴格的方式來減少排放。」

綠色和平英國執行總監 John Sauven 透露：「航空公司在懇求緩釋的同時，還在各方積極遊說，來逃避減排的責任。」

「事實上，這些污染大戶一直對碳排放稅之類的計劃俯首貼耳，因為可以用錢來將責任推卸給其他人，同時繼續肆虐。現在航空業的建議只是想進一步讓自己過得輕鬆一點罷了。」

# Airlines lobby to rewrite carbon deal in light of coronavirus
Airlines are lobbying to rewrite the rules of a global agreement designed to tackle aviation emissions, with the coronavirus outbreak expected to make its targets tougher to meet.

Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to “dodge their obligations”, but the industry said it was “a matter of survival”, with most [international travel currently frozen](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/01/financial-help-for-airlines-should-come-with-strict-climate-conditions) in the Covid-19 crisis.

<strong>The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to amend the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (Corsia), or risk airlines pulling out.</strong>

<strong>Under the system, airlines have to pay to offset any growth in carbon emissions above a baseline set by the average emissions of 2019 and 2020. The grounding of aircraft during the pandemic means the baseline will be far lower than envisaged, and the carbon targets much more challenging, if Corsia goes ahead without changes.</strong>

<strong>Iata has told ICAO that the baseline “must be adjusted to ensure the sustainable development of international aviation and avoid an inappropriate economic burden on the sector”. It said some nations could pull out of the agreement if the costs were too high.</strong>

Before the Covid-19 crisis, estimates showed that airlines were likely to have to spend between £4bn and £18bn a year globally on carbon credits by 2035 to satisfy the Corsia rules. <strong>A report by the Green Alliance, before the coronavirus lockdown, found that this was not enough to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement.</strong>

<strong>The ICAO council had signed off on the Corsia plans on 13 March, gaining plaudits from green campaigners for sticking with its pledges on the climate crisis instead of shelving them in the face of the pandemic. However, airlines’ commitment now looks distinctly shaky.</strong>

The US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a long-time mover behind the Corsia scheme, argued that the existing Corsia rules allowed enough flexibility for governments to address the “suppressed activity in 2020, without any need to renegotiate the measure in a drawn-out political discussion”.

<strong>James Elliott, a Green Alliance policy adviser, said: “Calls to reduce burdens on the [aviation] sector as it recovers are understandable. But the climate emergency also presents an urgent challenge which must be addressed. If the sector cannot find ways to rebuild itself sustainably after the Covid-19 crisis, it will face painful disruption again in the future as its part in the climate emergency has to be addressed.</strong>

<strong>“If Corsia is amended, it must be done in a way which also strengthens its ambition, with targets to limit and reduce actual emissions levels.”</strong>

<strong>Greenpeace UK’s executive director, John Sauven, said: “At the same time as they’re asking for huge government bailouts, airlines are also lobbying furiously to dodge their obligations towards cutting carbon emissions.</strong>

<strong>“Offsetting schemes have always been big polluters’ favourite excuse to carry on polluting while shifting responsibility for their emissions to someone else. The industry’s current proposal would only make the buck-passing easier.”</strong>

> 「事實上，這些污染大戶一直對碳排放稅之類的計劃俯首貼耳，因為可以用錢來將責任推卸給其他人，同時繼續肆虐。現在航空業的建議只是想進一步讓自己過得輕鬆一點罷了。」

Iata denied that it was backing away from Corsia. Its director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: “We haven’t given up our environmental goals … After the recovery we will continue to reduce emissions and noise footprints – that hasn’t changed.

“This crisis is a matter of survival for the industry … We are asking governments for urgent help. Of course we will comply with our environmental obligations. Before that, we have to survive – or there will be no issue with the environment, the industry will have disappeared.”
