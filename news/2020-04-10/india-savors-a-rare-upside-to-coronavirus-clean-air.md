新德里是世界上空氣污染最嚴重的城市之一，就算沒有瘟疫，人們也習慣與戴口罩，來過濾空氣中的有害微粒。最近，一個罕見而美妙的現象發生了：清澈湛藍的天空。

由於新冠的禁足令，新德里街頭沒有了汽車，工廠不再排放黑煙，沒有工地在運作，這個印度的特大都市的污染降到[不可思議的低位](https://www.cpcb.nic.in/air/NCR/jantacurfew.pdf)。

一個80歲的新德里居民說，幾十年從未呼吸過如此清新的空氣。

不止新德里，金奈、艾哈迈达巴德、班加羅爾、加濟阿巴德，整個印度的所有城市，空氣突然變得可以呼吸了。洛杉磯、紐約、北京、首爾和米蘭這些大城市同樣因為疫情禁足，而獲得空氣質量的改善。

但上述這些城市跟印度城市的污染程度無法相提並論，去年，世界空氣污染前20城市中，印度佔了14座，再次成為世界之最。

在新德里，尤其冬天，冷空氣凝固了汽車尾氣和工廠廢氣，風也停了，該地的空氣污染指標會高達 500（一般城市的平均指標大概是38）。很多人會因此咳嗽甚至患上肺病。

當然，所有人都心知肚明，潔淨的空氣，是經濟停滯的副作用。印度是全球禁足措施最嚴厲的國家之一，工廠關門、飛機禁飛、的士停載、公共交通全部叫停。很多印度人遵守命令留在家中，這個擁有13億人口的國家，集體被軟禁。

多個環保倡議人士，就此現象指出，印度並不是某些人所宣傳的那樣，因為地理位置和氣候的原因而空氣污濁。環保活動家兼企業家 Jai Dhar Gupta 說：「很明顯，這不是無法改變的，我們已經親眼見證了改變。」

一些離喜馬拉雅山脈百餘英里的城鎮可以[看見雪頂](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/ludhiana/from-jalandhar-rooftops-dhauladhar-in-full-glory/articleshow/74975862.cms)了。有些人開玩笑說他們可以從旁遮普邦看到加拿大；另一些人說空氣乾淨得[快可以看見上帝了](https://twitter.com/deepscribble/status/1246773230422994945)。

同樣的事情在中國也發生了：PM2.5 微粒濃度比正常水平下降了 30%，由汽車及工廠排放的氮化物也分別下降了 10% 和 20%。

但中國的空氣質素好景不常，因為工廠逐漸開工，汽車也開始上路了，[北京的空氣質量已經再次惡化](https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/cn/)。

印度現在還處於禁令之中，路上依然沒有喇叭，沒有行人叫囂與推讓。公共空間冷清開闊，終於能聽到鳥鳴。新德里市民今日觀察到了[印度灰犀鳥](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indian_grey_hornbill)和[紅喉鶲](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/红喉姬鹟)。

有些晚上，日落之後，另一道罕見的風景出現：金星閃亮於天空，沒有任何東西遮擋蒼穹，純黑的天幕佈滿星點，從四面八方包圍著心懷安慰的人們。

# India Savors a Rare Upside to Coronavirus: Clean Air

Delhi residents are stunned by how blue the sky really is as a strict lockdown cuts back drastically on air pollution.

* April 8, 2020

NEW DELHI — There are countless downsides to the world’s getting walloped by the coronavirus and being put under severe lockdown.

<strong>But here in one of the most polluted cities on earth, where many people routinely wear face masks to filter out the filth, something rare and wonderful has emerged: **a pure blue sky.**</strong>

> 新德里是世界上空氣污染最嚴重的城市之一，就算沒有瘟疫，人們也習慣與戴口罩，來過濾空氣中的有害微粒。最近，一個罕見而美妙的現象發生了：清澈湛藍的天空。

<strong>Because there are so few cars on the road, few factories belching out black smoke and almost no active construction sites to create clouds of choking dust, pollution levels in New Delhi, India’s megalopolis capital, have dropped to [remarkably low levels](https://www.cpcb.nic.in/air/NCR/jantacurfew.pdf).</strong>

At night there are stars. During the day the air is so clean that, for once, you can’t taste it, free of the usual smoky metallic tang. One cruelty of the coronavirus is to be under a tight lockdown right now, with parks bolted shut, ordered to stay indoors unless vitally necessary, only to look out your windows and see this.

And the lockdown has spelled economic misery for the millions of people who have been prevented from working.

<strong>But old-timers say Delhi’s air hasn’t been this clear for decades.</strong>

> 一個80歲的新德里居民說，幾十年從未呼吸過如此清新的空氣。

“I look at the sky quite often and enjoy its blueness from my balcony,” said Sudhir Kumar Bose, 80, a retired English professor.

“I don’t know how long this will last,” he added. “But right now I feel much better.”

<strong>It’s not just Delhi, but Chennai, Ahmedabad, Bengaluru and Ghaziabad. All across India, cities can suddenly breathe. Los Angeles, New York, Beijing, Seoul and Milan — [they have experienced less pollution](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/climate/coronavirus-pollution.html), too, hit hard by the virus and restrictions on people’s movement.</strong>

> 不止新德里，金奈、艾哈迈达巴德、班加羅爾、加濟阿巴德，整個印度的所有城市，空氣突然變得可以呼吸了。洛杉磯、紐約、北京、首爾和米蘭這些大城市同樣因為疫情禁足，而獲得空氣質量的改善。

But those places aren’t nearly as polluted as India. Nowhere is. <strong>Last year, once again, [India topped the charts of the worst polluted](https://www.iqair.com/world-most-polluted-cities) as home to 14 of the 20 cities with the most hazardous air.</strong>

> 但上述這些城市跟印度城市的污染程度無法相提並論，去年，世界空氣污染前20城市中，印度佔了14座，再次成為世界之最。

Delhi is among them, but last week it recorded a pollution reading of 38 on the Air Quality Index, about as good as anywhere in the world and stunning to Delhiites who have become steeled to a reading of 150 AQI — on a good day.

<strong>Sometimes, especially in the winter, as cold air condenses car exhaust and factory smoke and wind speeds drop, Delhi’s AQI (which measures different airborne pollutants) can shoot up to 500 or more. That gives many people chronic coughs and more serious lung disease.</strong>

But now sick people are savoring the reprieve.

“My old patients say they can’t believe it,” said Dr. Arvind Kumar, a Delhi chest surgeon who has been studying the consequences of living in a place with bad air. “They are feeling lighter, they are using their inhalers less frequently, most of them are feeling better.”

<strong>Of course, everyone knows this is a sign of the frozen economy. The clear skies are a consequence of a [tight lockdown](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/world/asia/india-coronavirus-lockdown.html) — the world’s biggest and one of the most severe — that has shuttered factories, grounded flights, evicted taxis, rickshaws and crowded buses from the roads and brought movement to a screeching halt. Many Indians are obeying the orders to stay indoors in a lockdown that has become a national house arrest for a nation of 1.3 billion people.</strong>

<strong>Environmentalists are using these strange times to make a point. One of the most outspoken, [Jai Dhar Gupta](https://nirvanabeing.com/why-us/), an Ivy League-educated environmental activist and entrepreneur, has been fighting for years against the widely held belief that India is somehow doomed to suffer bad air because of its geography and climate.</strong>

<strong>“Clearly,” he said, “this is not something that can’t be reversed. We’ve just reversed it.”</strong>

<strong>Towns more than a hundred miles from the Himalayas [can now see snow peaks](https://m.timesofindia.com/city/ludhiana/from-jalandhar-rooftops-dhauladhar-in-full-glory/articleshow/74975862.cms). Some people joked that they could see Canada from Punjab State. Others said the air was so clear [they would soon be able to see God](https://twitter.com/deepscribble/status/1246773230422994945).</strong>

The sky over Delhi is usually smudge gray, day or night. The gauze never lifts. The sun sets mildly behind it.

Across much of China, too, air pollutants plunged after a lockdown to stifle the epidemic closed factories, cut road traffic and drastically reduced air travel.

<strong>China’s restrictions from January helped cut small, health-threatening pollutants called PM 2.5 — for being less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, the smallest and most dangerous particles that are monitored — by as much as 30 percent below normal levels</strong>, according to the [Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service](https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/amid-coronavirus-outbreak-copernicus-monitors-reduction-particulate-matter-pm25-over-china). Levels of nitrogen dioxide, a pollutant caused by motor vehicles and industry, also fell between 10 and 20 percent.

> 同樣的事情在中國也發生了：PM2.5 微粒濃度比正常水平下降了 30%，由汽車及工廠排放的氮化物也分別下降了 10% 和 20%。

“This is the first time I have seen such a dramatic drop-off over such a wide area for a specific event,” said Fei Liu, an air quality researcher at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, [according to a report from NASA](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/146362/airborne-nitrogen-dioxide-plummets-over-china).

<strong>But in China the near-pristine skies are already passing. There have been [more bad days recently](https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/cn/), as factories have restarted and more vehicles have returned to the roads.</strong>

> 但中國的空氣質素好景不常，因為工廠逐漸開工，汽車也開始上路了，[北京的空氣質量已經再次惡化](https://aqicn.org/city/beijing/cn/)。

In India, the lockdown is still in full effect, and it is unclear when it will be lifted. Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, imposed the strictures at the end of March, saying they would be for 21 days. But many people fear he was just lowballing to keep the public from becoming too dispirited.

With some of the world’s poorest, most densely packed slums, India has a huge risk of a coronavirus crisis. Health officials are racing to contain the highly contagious disease, which could rip through areas where millions live face to face. With India’s reported cases [doubling around every four days](https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/coronavirus-india-covid-19-cases-doubling-every-4-days-set-to-touch-17-000-in-a-week-2207289) and now topping 4,000, many people are bracing for a long lockdown.

At least there will be some dispensations.

<strong>There’s almost no honking, no shouting, no jostling. Roads and public spaces are wide open and empty, perfect to see — and hear — birds. Delhiites are now [spotting rare birds](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/role-reversal-with-humans-caged-in-birds-fill-the-silence-as-sightings-go-up/articleshow/74975750.cms) like gray hornbills and red-throated flycatchers.</strong>

<strong>The other evening, after sunset, another rare delight showed itself: Venus, shining crisp and bright and steady with nothing to obscure it. The pure black sky was bursting with stars, wrapping around us, endless but somehow consoling.</strong>
